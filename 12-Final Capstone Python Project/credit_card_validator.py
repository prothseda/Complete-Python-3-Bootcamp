'''
Numbers Capstone Project: Credit Card Validator
Takes in a credit card number from a common credit card vendor
and validates it to make sure that it is a valid number

This is acomplished by using the Luhn Algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm
    Step 1 – Starting from the rightmost digit, double the value of every second digit
    Step 2 – If doubling of a number results in a value greater than 9 then add the digits of the product
    Step 3 – Now take the sum of all the digits (including non-doubled)
    Step 4 – If the total modulo 10 is equal to 0 then the number is valid else it is not valid

Example:
    Starting with 79927398713
    We get 79947697723
    Sum is 70
    modulo 10 of 70 equals 0
    79927398713 is valid.

Possible additions:
    * Detection of card type (Visa or MasterCard)

# User inputs a Credit Card Number


# Validate that the input string is all numeric


# Step 1 – Starting from the rightmost digit, double the value of every second digit


# Step 2 – If doubling of a number results in a value greater than 9 then add the digits of the product


# Step 3 – Now take the sum of all the digits (including non-doubled)


# Step 4 – If the total modulo 10 is equal to 0 then the number is valid else it is not valid


# Inform the User if the input Credit Card Number is valid or not
